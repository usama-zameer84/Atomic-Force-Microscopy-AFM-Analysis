# Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Analysis App

This repository contains an application designed for analyzing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) data. AFM is a powerful technique used to analyze surface characteristics at the nanometer scale, providing crucial insights into material properties. This app allows users to load AFM data, estimate slopes, and visualize results interactively through a web-based interface powered by **Streamlit**.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load AFM data from `.npy`, `.txt`, or `.pickled` formats.
- **Slope Estimation**: Analyze AFM height data to estimate slopes at given locations.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize AFM data using 3D surface plots and cross-sectional profiles.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests ensure the robustness of the data loading, slope estimation, and visualization functionalities.

## Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Overview

AFM is a type of scanning probe microscopy that provides nanoscale imaging by measuring forces between a sharp probe and the sample surface. It is commonly used in fields like materials science, biology, and nanotechnology to examine the topography and mechanical properties of surfaces with atomic-level resolution.

The core principle behind AFM is the interaction between a cantilever and the surface of a sample. As the cantilever scans the surface, any changes in surface height cause deflections in the cantilever, which are then converted into an image. This makes AFM a powerful tool for measuring roughness, elasticity, and various surface forces.

### Force-Distance Curves

Force-distance curves in AFM provide crucial information about the mechanical properties of a material. These curves are generated by recording the force exerted by the cantilever tip as it approaches and retracts from the sample surface. Analyzing these curves allows us to estimate properties like stiffness, adhesion forces, and elasticity.

In this project, the force-distance curves are processed and displayed, and the slope of these curves is estimated using polynomial fitting. This slope can then be interpreted to determine how the material behaves under the applied force.
